## About this app
This is a Body Mass Index calculator. Based on the userâ€™s weight and height it will calculate their body mass and give a piece of health advice depending on whether if they have eaten too many pies or if they need to eat more pies. In this app I use:
* UIKit/programmatically layout.
* Multi-screen apps with animated navigation.
* Optional binding, optional chaining and the nil coalescing operator.
* Formatting Strings.
